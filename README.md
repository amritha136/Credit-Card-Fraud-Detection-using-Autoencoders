# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Autoencoders
In today's digital economy, credit card fraud represents a significant challenge for financial institutions, businesses, and consumers alike. 
Credit card fraud involves unauthorized transactions made using stolen or counterfeit card details. 
These fraudulent activities can cause substantial financial losses and damage to consumer trust. 

Traditional fraud detection methods usually depend on a set of rules and patterns, which can struggle to keep up with new and changing fraud tactics. 
Thus, there's a growing need for advanced machine learning techniques that can improve the accuracy and effectiveness of fraud detection systems. 

This project aims to use Autoencoders, a type of unsupervised neural network architecture, to improve the detection of credit card fraud. 
Autoencoders are particularly well-suited for anomaly detection due to their ability to learn and model the normal patterns of data, and subsequently identify deviations from these patterns.

The **Nilson Report** is one of the most respected source of news and analysis of the global card and mobile payment industry. 
As reported by the Nilson Report, the global fraud losses exceeded $36 billion in 2023, up 11.3% from 2022.
